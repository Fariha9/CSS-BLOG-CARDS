        <h1>The Huffington Post</h1>
        <p>The history of political blogging might usefully be divided into the periods pre- and post-Huffington. Before
            the millionaire socialite Arianna Huffington decided to get in on the act, bloggers operated in a spirit of
            underdog solidarity. They hated the mainstream media - and the feeling was mutual.</p>

        <h1>Boing Boing</h1>
        <p>Lego reconstructions of pop videos and cakes baked in the shape of iPods are not generally considered
            relevant to serious political debate. But even the most earnest bloggers will often take time out of their
            busy schedule to pass on some titbit of mildly entertaining geek ephemera. No one has done more to promote
            pointless, yet strangely cool, time-wasting stuff on the net than the editors of Boing Boing (subtitle: A
            Directory of Wonderful Things). </p>

        <h1> Techcrunch</h1>
        <p>Techcrunch began in 2005 as a blog about dotcom start-ups in Silicon Valley, but has quickly become one of
            the most influential news websites across the entire technology industry. Founder Michael Arrington had
            lived through the internet goldrush as a lawyer and entrepreneur before deciding that writing about new
            companies was more of an opportunity than starting them himself. </p>

        <h1>Kottke</h1>
        <p>One of the early wave of blogging pioneers, web designer Jason Kottke started keeping track of interesting
            things on the internet as far back as 1998. The site took off, boosted partly through close links to popular
            blog-building website Blogger (he later married one of the founders).</p>

        <h1>Dooce</h1>

        <p>One of the best-known personal bloggers (those who provide more of a diary than a soapbox or reporting
            service), Heather Armstrong has been writing online since 2001. Though there were personal websites that
            came before hers, certain elements conspired to make Dooce one of the biggest public diaries since Samuel
            Pepys's (whose diary is itself available, transcribed in blog form, at Pepysdiary.com). </p>
